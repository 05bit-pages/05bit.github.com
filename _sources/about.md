# About

Hello! Do you like our <a href="/works/">works</a>?

We can provide you **server-side programming**:

- create a mobile application server
- create a web application API server
- build website with ready design and markup

And if you need to build a **project from scratch**, please do not hesitate to write us anyway!

## Approach

Our basic approach to project creation can be described in 3 steps:

1. Make it work as fast as possible!
2. Make it beautiful!
3. Repeat if needed.

If project is large and complex, it's splitted into smaller steps. So we encourage iterative development procees to achive visible results as fast as possible!
